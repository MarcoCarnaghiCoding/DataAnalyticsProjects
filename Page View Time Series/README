For this project, I will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots; and dedicated librarys such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on a web forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.
The data visualizations will help to understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
